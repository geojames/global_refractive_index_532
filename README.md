# Welcome to the Global Refractive Index Project Page
The goal of this project is to provide monthly raster datasets of the refractive index of water at 532 nanometers for use in correcting airborne and spaceborne bathymetric lidar datasets.

**The methodology for these data are currently in the publication pipeline - please check back for the paper (or click the Watch and Star button above for updates)**

### Folders
**Code**: Contains the Python code used to create the raster layers

**Data**: Contains the global raster data layers, one raster (geotiff) stack per year (currently 2016-2024)
