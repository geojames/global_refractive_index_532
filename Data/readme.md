# Welcome to the Global Refractive Index Data Page

This folder contains the raster data files for the refractive index of water at 532 nanometers (green lasers) for use in correcting airborne and spaceborne bathymetric lidar datasets.

The refractive index is notated as $n$ and the refractive index od water as $n_w$, so we adopt a convension of $n_w (532)$ for the refractive index of water at 532 nm.

The raster data have a resolution of 0.25Â° and are projected in Lat/Long (WGS84, EPSG:4326)

### Release Version 1.1
- Monthly Data = 1993 Jan - 2024 Aug
- Weekly Data = 2018 Jan 3 - 2024 Sept 10

**Each full year (1993 - 2023) of monthly data contains 14 raster bands:**
- Bands 1-12 = Months of the year (1=Jan, 2=Feb, ..., 12 = Dec)
- Band 13 = Annual Average

**Each partial year of monthly data (2024):**
- Bands 1-x = Months of the year (1=Jan, 2=Feb, ...)

**Weekly data are 1 file per week with 1 band**

#### File nameing convension:
> armor3d_nw532_[date]\_[monthly\\weekly]\_[processing_level].tif
- armor3d = Source dataset [ARMOR3D L4](https://data.marine.copernicus.eu/product/MULTIOBS_GLO_PHY_TSUV_3D_MYNRT_015_012/description)
  - MULTIOBS\_GLO\_PHY\_TSUV\_3D\_MYNRT\_015\_012 
- nw532 = refractive index of water at 532 nm
- date = 
  - Monthly - year covered by the file (1 band per month)
  - Weekly - Sart and end dates of the file (1 band total)
- processing level = from ARMOR3D L4: REP
  - NRT: Near-Real Time, ~1 month lag before present
  - REP: Reprocessed, 12 to 24 months lag before present - "The REP datasets benefit from the highest quality ocean observations input."
